# Data for making a general description of Cyber Punk film
There are many cyberpunk movies, however, I have selected the following to review: Robocop, Tron, Alitalia: Battle Angel, Ready Player One, Archive, Terminator, and the Matrix movies.
# Rating and causion for certain audiences
Based of my research I have concluded that most cyberpunk movies are mature audience favored and include much of violence, profanity, intensity, and  immodest content . 
These movies I would recommend be 18 and up for the maturity level required for many of these movies. 
However not all are like this. Tron is a great sit down movie for any one. Ready Player one  would be best  for kids 14  and up. 
# Solutions to the situation
However not all are like this. Tron is a great sit down movie for any one. Ready Player one  would be best  for kids 14  and up. 
Vid angel costs $9.99 per month, this tv channel offers movies that are normally inappropriate and sensors them.  
# Description of Cyber Punk Movies
All of these movies are about mostly the same material. 
Here is my overview of cyberpunk movies based off of my data from my previously mentioned movies.
These movies have so much in common I realized that all types of movies take place in the future  and are all based on corrupt people or A.I. that  try to take control of an  apocalyptic world.  
Every movie is similar in  constructing a main character that takes it upon themselves to discover the truth
and  discovering conspiracyâ€™s  along the way that reveal the current overlords of their time
ending the movies in  defeat of the villain and a happy ending for the main character.
